Childhood with diabetes When I was young, it was hard because I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t eat sweets or have sugary drinks. God bless my mum, she didn’t understand either. So, Mum never went out of her way to give me sugar-free drinks. She used to bake cakes and would never tell me I couldn’t have any. When my sugars went really high, the GP would just come out and give me a big dose of insulin.

Gastroparesis a long-term complication of diabetes that can be caused by fluctuating blood sugars causing nerve damage (neuropathy). Damage to these nerves can result in gastroparesis, where food isn’t moved out of the stomach as quickly as normal. It’s thought to be the result of a problem with the nerves and muscles that control how the stomach empties. Symptoms of this can include bloating, constipation, diarrhoea, having pain or discomfort in the upper part of the tummy, and feeling or being sick. Having gastroparesis means your food is being digested slowly, and at unpredictable times, which can affect your blood sugar levels.

I learned invaluable tools, like what to do when you are sick and I also met up with other people living with type 1. I knew I wasn’t alone. It was great at lunchtime as we’d all pull our meters out and test before eating! I’m still in touch with some of the people I met now and we catch up about our diabetes.  My team at the hospital are great, they got me on an\\xa0education course for people who are newly diagnosed with type 1 about six months after my diagnosis, which was so helpful in coming to terms with my condition.

I knew I wanted to use an insulin pump and my team were all for it. I got my pump about 18 months after diagnosis. The pump has been a godsend to me, I know it’s not for everyone but I find it so helpful and don’t mind being attached to it at all. Last year my consultant approved me for a flash glucose monitor (Libre) trial and I now have that on prescription too. I feel very fortunate to have such a great team looking after me.

Mental wellbeing The past ten years haven’t all been plain sailing. There have been times, when having this condition has been tough. There are times when I want a day off from the checking of numbers, calculating the carbs in my meals. Mentally it’s hard. Physically it’s hard too, hypos can leave me feeling shaky for hours. Constant worrying about my health is draining. But I carry on, as we all do. I’ve had to come to terms with living with a long-term health condition, it’s not easy, but some days are better than others. You have to take the small wins when you can.

Insulin and food When I arrived home from hospital I was worried about how much insulin I was going to need to take. It was all trial and error to start with. I had my first hypo alone, and that was scary. I called my husband who came home from work to be with me, and throughout my ongoing journey with diabetes he has been so supportive. I started carb counting initially through advice from the online forum. It’s trial and error in the beginning, especially when I was using pens as you can’t do very small doses like you can with a pump. I think carb counting has been one of the most beneficial things for managing my diabetes along with managing my insulin to cover food before eating.\\xa0  When I arrived home from hospital I was worried about how much insulin I was going to need to take.

Enjoy Food Work and study  In 2018 I started a master’s degree in History of Science and Medicine that I did part time while working. I wrote my dissertation on diabetes in the post-insulin era, something I probably wouldn’t have considered doing had I not been diagnosed with the condition myself. I’ve been working as a fundraiser for Diabetes UK since 2014, and took over managing the membership team in 2018. I love my job, being able to raise funds for Diabetes UK gives me a great sense of satisfaction. Knowing that all of our dedicated supporters and members are helping us to achieve our mission and assisting with our vital research in to all types of diabetes, gives me hope for the future, for all of us out there living with this condition, that we may finally find a cure.
